Overview:
A coffee shop website offers a digital presence for a local cafe, providing information on the menu, shop location, hours, and contact details. The design will be warm and inviting, with an intuitive layout showcasing the coffee shop's atmosphere and offerings. The use of HTML provides structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity.

Coffee Shop Website Structure
1. HTML Structure
The HTML will include key sections:

Header: Contains the logo and navigation links (Home, Menu, About Us, Contact Us).
Hero Section: A large welcoming banner showcasing the coffee shop's atmosphere and a call-to-action button (like "Order Online").
Menu Section: A grid layout displaying coffee items with images, names, and prices.
About Us Section: A brief story of the coffee shop, its origins, and its values.
Contact Section: Information like the address, hours of operation, and a simple contact form for customers to reach out.
Footer: Contains social media icons and additional links.
2. CSS Styling
CSS will enhance the design with:

Typography: Elegant fonts like a cursive font for headers (evoking a handwritten chalkboard menu) and a clean, readable font for body text.
Color Scheme: Earthy tones (coffee browns, creams, and light beige) to match the cafe vibe.
Responsive Design: The website should be responsive to ensure it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
Grid Layout: CSS Grid or Flexbox will be used to arrange the menu items and other sections like About Us and Contact.
Hover Effects: Subtle animations for buttons and images, such as hover effects on the menu items to reveal more details.
3. JavaScript Interactivity
JavaScript will add functionality such as:

Smooth Scrolling: When a user clicks on a navigation link, the page will smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.
Interactive Menu: The menu section could allow users to filter coffee items by type (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino).
Form Validation: The contact form will use JavaScript to check that all fields are filled out before submission, ensuring a good user experience.
Dynamic Content: JavaScript can dynamically load new coffee items or promotions without refreshing the page.
